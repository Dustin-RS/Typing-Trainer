# Typing Trainer
Typing Trainer is a Python project for training your typing speed.
Written in python.
It works simply, it parses a random page from Wikipedia and then you need to type text into an invisible input box.
The input box automatically checks the correction of the entered data.
While you are typing - the program takes measurements, and when you press the Stop button, it prints the results and the input field stops working until you press the Start button.
